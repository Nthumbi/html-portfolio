<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I’m George — a passionate and curious full stack web developer with a 
  growing toolkit and a big vision for the future of the web.</p>

<p>
My journey into web development started with a simple fascination: how does 
the internet work? That question led me down a rabbit hole of HTML tags, 
JavaScript functions, CSS rules, and eventually, full stack application development. 
Today, I specialize in building dynamic, user-focused websites and applications using 
tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Git. I enjoy crafting clean, responsive 
interfaces on the front end and building solid, efficient logic on the back end.
</p>

<p>
What drives me is the thrill of problem-solving and the opportunity to bring ideas to 
life in the browser. Whether I’m debugging a stubborn piece of code or pushing a new 
feature to GitHub, I’m constantly learning and growing — because in tech, standing 
still isn’t an option.
</p>

<p>
Looking ahead, I aspire to contribute to projects that make a real impact, from 
startups to open-source communities. I’m especially interested in building tools that 
empower others, improve accessibility, and make the web a more beautiful and inclusive place.
